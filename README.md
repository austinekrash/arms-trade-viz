# The Price of War
[The Price of War](priceofwar.us) is an interactive map illustrating the role of the United States in the global arms trade. It uses data from the [Stockholm International Peace Institute's Arms Transfer Database](https://www.sipri.org/databases/armstransfers) Upon hitting the website, users are greeted by a short instructional blurb, some options to interact with the map, and of course the map itself.
